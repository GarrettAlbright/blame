This file is meant to be a running list of tasks, questions or concerns
that are still pending as the development of this module continues.

Questions / Thoughts / Ideas:

1. Currently, in order to administer the blame module, you need to have the
   permission "administer site configuration". I'm wondering if it would be
   more appropriate to have a custom permission from the blame module for this,
   or if a user with the "administer site configuration" should be fine.
2. Every time a form is submitted, a couple of things are definitely going to
   change. For example, the [changed] timestamp will of course change, and the
   [form_build_id] will always change. I'm wondering if it would be best to 
   withhold these fields from output since it will always be different? Or
   maybe this would be something to allow an admin to turn on or off at their
   discretion from the modules settings?

TODO's:

1. When a diff is performed on a record set, the module currently highlights
   the entire field that was changed. It would be nice to actually highlight
   the specific change for quicker identification.
